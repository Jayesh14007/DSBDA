Sure, let's go through the code line by line and explain what each part does.

```python
import pandas as pd
import io
```
Here, the `pandas` library is imported and aliased as `pd`. This library is used for data manipulation and analysis. The `io` module is imported for handling file input/output operations, although it doesn't seem to be used in the subsequent code.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('dataset_Facebook.csv')
df.head(5)
```
This code reads a CSV file named 'dataset_Facebook.csv' into a pandas DataFrame called `df` and then displays the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using `head()` method.

```python
df['type']
```
This line selects a specific column from the DataFrame `df`. In this case, it selects the 'type' column.

```python
print(df.columns)
```
This line prints the names of all columns in the DataFrame.

```python
df[['type','category']]
```
This line selects two specific columns ('type' and 'category') from the DataFrame.

```python
df.describe()
```
This line generates descriptive statistics of the DataFrame like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for numerical columns.

```python
#subset-1
df1=df[['pagetotallikes','category','postmonth','postweekday']].loc[0:15]
df1
```
Here, a subset of the original DataFrame `df` is created containing only specific columns ('pagetotallikes', 'category', 'postmonth', 'postweekday') and rows from index 0 to 15.

```python
#subset-2
df2=df[['pagetotallikes','category','postmonth','postweekday']].loc[16:30]
df2
```
Similarly, another subset of `df` is created containing rows from index 16 to 30.

```python
#subset-3
df3=df[['pagetotallikes','category','postmonth','postweekday']].loc[31:50]
df3
```
Another subset is created containing rows from index 31 to 50.

```python
#merging all subset
merging=pd.concat([df1,df2,df3])
merging
```
These lines concatenate (combine) the three subsets (`df1`, `df2`, and `df3`) into a single DataFrame named `merging`.

```python
df.loc[1]
```
This line selects a specific row (index 1) from the DataFrame `df`.

```python
df.loc[[1,5,7]]
```
Similarly, this line selects multiple rows (indexes 1, 5, and 7) from the DataFrame `df`.

```python
df.loc[1:7,['like','share']]
```
This line selects specific rows (indexes 1 to 7) and specific columns ('like' and 'share') from the DataFrame `df`.

```python
df.sort_values(by = "like",ascending= False)
```
This line sorts the DataFrame `df` based on the values in the column 'like', in descending order.

```python
df.sort_values("like")
```
This line sorts the DataFrame `df` based on the values in the column 'like', in ascending order.

```python
df.sort_values(by = "like",ascending= False, kind="mergesort")
```
This line sorts the DataFrame `df` based on the values in the column 'like', in descending order, using the 'mergesort' algorithm.

```python
df.sort_values(by=["like", "share"])
```
This line sorts the DataFrame `df` based on multiple columns, first by 'like' and then by 'share'.

The next part of the code deals with operations like transposing data, selecting specific columns, creating pivot tables, concatenating DataFrames, and merging DataFrames using different keys. I can continue explaining these parts if you'd like, or if you have specific questions about any part, feel free to ask!
